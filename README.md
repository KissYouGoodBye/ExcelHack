The default request address format for each search is as follows. Note that the keywords searched in the link use `%SELECTION%` instead.

| Engine | Url                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Google | https://www.google.com/search?q=%SELECTION% |
| Bing   | https://www.bing.com/search?q=%SELECTION%   |
| Github | https://www.github.com/search?q=%SELECTION% |
| Baidu  | https://www.baidu.com/search?q=%SELECTION%  |
| Npm    | https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%SELECTION%  |

Or modify the `.vscode/setting.json` file to change the default search engine. For example, modify to the following configuration, then every time you click on `Search Online`, you will use `Bing` to search for related content.

```json
{
  "search-online.search-engine": "Bing"
}
```

Or modify the `.vscode/setting.json` file to add a new search engine. For example, by modifying `.vscode/setting.json` below, two new search engines, Visual Studio Marketplace and Pypi, are added.

```json
{
  "search-online.add-search-engine": [
    {
      "name": "Visual Studio Marketplace",
      "url": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=%SELECTION%&target=VSCode"
    },
    {
      "name": "Pypi",
      "url": "https://pypi.org/search/?q=%SELECTION%"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also use the add search engine option to manually add a search engine, you need to provide the name and search address, for exampleâ†“.
